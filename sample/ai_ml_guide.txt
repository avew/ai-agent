Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Guide

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include:

- Speech recognition
- Learning
- Planning  
- Problem solving
- Perception
- Motion and manipulation

Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Finds hidden patterns in data without labels
   - Examples: Clustering, Association
   - Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Uses rewards and penalties
   - Applications: Game playing, Robotics

Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural networks.

Key concepts:
- Neural Networks
